Interior Design website for a client built using React.js. One thing I would like a workaround for is the news page, I had a direct Instagram API key working a little while ago which does now not work, I've had to use a widget from an external site that lacks customization and is just not really the way I would prefer to do it.

## Technologies

HTML, SASS, Javascript, React, Material UI, React Router DOM, FormSubmit.
